// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, it defines the expectations of what type of software is being built/modified."
const design = "This is the third step, it outlines the details of the project in regards to user and system interface, network requirements, and databases."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step. Here is where system configuration is included and the creation of functional software."
const testingAndIntegration = "Once the build of the software is done, it goes into testing to check for any risks in the code such as bugs before sending it out in the market for users."
const maintain = "Once the software reaches the market, constant updates to fix bugs and other patches that may have not been caught in the testing phae are caught here to uphold the software for the users."
